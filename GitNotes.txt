If you have not committed the deletion, you can simply run git checkout HEAD <filename> to restore the file1.
If you have committed the deletion but not pushed it to the remote, you can reset your local branch to the previous commit using git reset --hard HEAD~112. This will discard all the changes after that commit, including the deletion.
If you have committed and pushed the deletion to the remote, you can either revert the commit that deleted the file using git revert --no-commit <commit>23, or checkout the file from an earlier commit using git checkout <commit hash> -- <filename>12. You can use git log -- <filename> or git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <filename>4 to find the commit hash of the last commit that had the file or deleted the file.
